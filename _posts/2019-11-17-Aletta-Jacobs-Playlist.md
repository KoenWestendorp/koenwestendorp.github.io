## Description
For those moments when you want to experience the fierce, relentless, unforgiving orange walls of the Aletta Jacobs Building, yet experience vulnerable and touching moments during sporadic moments of silence. 

For you, dear listener, I have made a selection of tracks that reflect my mental image of ‘Aletta’. (Also I have many tracks in my library that have bio/science/orange colour-related names). 

First, this carefully curated playlist will carry you through hardest hitting parts of my music library, in an attempt to emulate the never ending construction noises. Whereafter, you will be led down a path of momentary silence and the understanding of the lecture’s contents that follows, symbolised by some of the most touching pieces in my collection. 
This pause can’t last too long, however. Slowly the percussive beating commences and experimentalism in music symbolises the start of a new period of intense auditive stimulation. 
The storm hits again—though somewhat less severe than before—and the statistical concept of the alternative hypothesis is explained. The end of the PowerPoint and the following rustling of students signifies the end of the lecture and shortly the orange flood will reach your eyes. Everything Is in Color, once you step outside the lecture hall. 
You take your bike and leave Zernike behind you. While riding Via the streets of Groningen, an ambiguous, hazy, yet heartfelt “I need you, come back...” starts to loop in your head—referring, of course, to your longing to the Aletta Jacobs Building.
