Currently I have a course on Biostatistics and after an inhumane number of assignment on the topic of--among other things--the critical t (t*) I just had to get these statistical ramblings out of my head. I felt like making a somewhat hazy, dub-like atmosfere that would reflect the insufferable uncertainty that statistics continually confronts you with. Slowly a hasty and hectic, though touching arpegiator steps towards you, symbolizing the structured and repettitive nature of this mathematical realm we students are trying to uncover. A high and varying level of saturation, and the subsequent bothered distortion it invokes, ties the pressing yet expansive fog-filled space together. 

Well, I hope so at least. There is still a *lot* of balancing and refinement to be done.

De groete, Koen
